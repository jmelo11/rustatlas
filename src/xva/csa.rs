//! CSA (Credit Support Annex) terms — per-client collateral and credit configuration.

//! Each counterparty (netting agreement) carries its own [`CsaTerms`]
//! describing the collateral treatment (which curve remunerates posted
//! collateral) and the credit/funding parameters used for CVA and FVA.
//! The struct is serde-deserializable so it can be loaded straight from
//! JSON configuration files.
